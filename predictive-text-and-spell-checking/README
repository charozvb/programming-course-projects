# Predictive text and spell-checking system

This project is part of an assignment for the course Advanced Programming.

## Description

The program simulates how a phone keyboard assists user while typing:
* if a word is spelled correctly, the program suggests the 3 most likely next words based on bigram frequencies from a corpus
* if a word is misspelled, the program suggests a possible correct spelling using edit-distance-1 operations
* if no reasonable correction exists, the program suggests random words from the lexicon
* the program continuously builds and displays the message typed so far
* the program runs interactively until it is manually interrupted

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The program requires 2 input files: a lexicon file (a list of valid English words, with one word per line), and a corpus file (a text corpus used to build the bigram frequency model)
* Libraries used: nltk, collections, random, sys

### Executing program

* AutoCorrect class:
** Implements 4 edit-distance operations: insertion, deletion, substitution, swapping
** Combines all edit suggestions into a single set

* Bigram model:
** Built from a corpus
** stores bigram frequencies
** used to suggest likely next words

* Main loop:
** Prompts the user for input
** Handles correct words, misspelled words, and unknown words
** Updates and prints the message so far

* Run the program from the command line:
```
python3 main.py lexicon.txt corpus.txt
```
